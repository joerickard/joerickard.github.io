			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I've attended CU Boulder for the past 2 years. While living in Boulder I picked up cycling as a hobby. I have been able to work with some amazing people, and enjoy producing interesting software products. I work most days at <a href="http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/"style="color:lightblue"target="_blank">LASP</a>.</p>

All this, of course, when I'm not on a <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/10227888"style="color:gold"target="_blank">Bike</a>.</p>
