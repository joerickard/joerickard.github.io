			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I've attended CU Boulder for the past 2 years. While living in Boulder I picked up cycling as a hobby. I have been able to work with some amazing people, and enjoy producing interesting software products. I work most days at LASP.</p>

			<p>In my down time I enjoy reading <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">news</a>, or playing <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198027228209/">games</a> with friends. All this, of course, when I'm not on a <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/10227888">bike</a>.</p>
