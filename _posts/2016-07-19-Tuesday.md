Coffee and Eigenvalues
---
A wonderful start to the day, being suprised by a friend at a caf√®. I then hurried to work where I spun up two CentOS VMs with the intent of playing around with Docker. I quickly was distracted by real work, and forgot about them until just now: tomorrow's project. In other project news, my DataLib project is coming along. I'm at a point now where I am writing the algorithms for finding Eigen Values, and am finding my knowledge insufficient. I have a small stack of PDFs to get through on the subject. I do have one naieve solution working... solving polynomials :|. Will be optimizing the function to recognize different types of matrices and apply any special algorithms I deem valuable.
