Olympic Ecxitement
---
Both the women's and men's olympic road races were exciting on that incredibly difficult course. Definitely worth waking up at 5:30 for the starts. In the men's race, Rafai Majka's performance was inspirational. Seeing him caught was a little heartbreaking, however I'm glad to have seen him with at least a bronze. In the women's race Mara Abbott wasa not nearly as fortunate. Her chase group was 3, rather than 2, and even with a similarly stellar performance came out with 4th place. The effort of the chase groups in both races was perfectly timed, and they deserve the medals they earned. I just like to see strong solo breakaways rewarded :) The whole event inspired me to go out riding more myself, have a few longer rides planned out now.
