Just Crammed So Full

Mental health is tough sometimes. I'm in a period of stress right now, where keeping some room in my mind to relax has been tough. Some old releases have gone, quite suddenly and without consent. But I don't mind the stress; it is due to some very cool classes and projects I have to work on. It feels good to gain the knowledge and experience. However I really need to find some better balance, where I stop having attacks of self-doubt and suffocation.
