Moving
---
So I decided mid-day at work that I need to finish my move from one appt to another. I reserved a pickup for the evening. It feels good to finally have everything out of the old place. I even found some unexpected help with the move in the form of a friend walking past my new place and being sucked into the ordeal. I then had a wonderful evening at Laughing Goat chatting up some new and some old friends on their pattio. The strange trying-to-rain but warm weather was perfect. I then stayed up to all hours of the night unpacking boxes, and then repacking a bag for a trip I am taking.
