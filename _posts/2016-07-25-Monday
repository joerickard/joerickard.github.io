After getting in to chicago and missing the start of the Mac race I've really enjoyed spending time with my Mother and Aunt. Missing the boat really did have a silver lining in more time with family and friends. Wicker park fest happened to line up this weekend, where I was able to see both diet cig and the coathangers before some apocolyptic rain sent everyone indoors and the festival tents flying down the street. On saturday I was lucky enough to meet the coathangers at Reggies, where they signed some records for me. It really has been a good trip so far. I'm looking forward to a few spin classes with my aunt and a bike ride this upcoming Sunday.
