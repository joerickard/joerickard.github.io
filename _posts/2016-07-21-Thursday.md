Flights and long days
---
I woke up a bit late this morning and could not stop for a redeye on the way to work as I normally would. A consequence of the unpacking last night. I am at work as I write this, a stack of papers on Eigen-math freshly printed on my desk; my prepared airplane reading. I fly to Chicago tonight rather late, and the flight is already showing a 3o minute delay. I will be racing the Mac with father/uncle. It should be a fun few days, and will cross an item off each of their bucket lists. I also look forward to spending some good time in the city seeing old friends and eating. With my mother's condo under construction and my dad living on a boat, I'm not quite sure where I will stay yet, but I have a few hours yet to figure that out. This page will likely be quiet for the next few days as I will be offshore.
